This project was inspired by a saying in an article that I read recently. It ever so casually stated that the only real deployment of ML models takes place on a powerpoint presentation and the words really resonated. This project aims to work around the saying by trying to achieve the creation of a complete CI/CD pipeline for a basic real-time predictor flask application using MLOps. The project currently only supports continuous building and deployment of new models to the application. This work can be extended to support continuous monitoring and continuous delivery on real-time dataset updations as well.
